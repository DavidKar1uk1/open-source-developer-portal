<h1 id=oauth-refresh-strategies-transfer>OAuth refresh strategies - Transfer</h1><h2 id=preemptively-refresh-authorization>Preemptively refresh authorization</h2><p>You set up a cron job that runs in the background every hour to refresh each user accountâ€™s OAuth access token.

You would first query your database for tokens that are about to expire, make a POST request to refresh authorization, and update your database to include the newly refreshed token pair. Note: Be prepared to handle errors gracefully while the cron job is running.</p>
